# Overview

-- NOTE --
Although the game was initially supposed to be created in Arcade, I was unable to
get it to work, and ultimately had to switch to PyGame instead.

Game Description:
This is a basic Chess Game using the PyGame library in Python. It provides a graphical interface for the player to engage in a game of chess on an standard 8x8 chessboard. The game features traditional chess pieces, including pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings, each with their unique movement rules. Players can make moves using the mouse, and the game checks for valid moves, checks, and checkmates as they play. The user can also save and load their a game.

How To Play:
Run the program.
The chessboard and pieces will be displayed.
Click on a piece to select it.
Click on a valid destination square to make a move.
The game checks for valid moves, displays checks, and announces checkmate if a player is defeated.

Purpose:
I wrote this game because I love chess and have always enjoyed playing it. I saw this as a challenge to create due to it being fairly complex, but also something that would be
enjoyable and fun. Creating this code also introduced me to a lot of things I hadn't coded or designed before, which meant I had to learn a lot as I went.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

Tools Used:
I used PYTHON for creating and coding the game itself - it was the primary programming language.
I used PYGAME as the game development library, and to create the GUI the game would use.
I used PICKLE to create the save/load function for the chess game.

Things to Improve in the Future:
Implement castling and en passant moves for a more complete and accurate chess game.
Enhance the graphical user interface to have it be more visually appealing.
Implement a timer feature for each turn.
Allow players to choose the color of their pieces at the start of the game.
Add sound effects for moves, checks, and checkmates.
Add a functioning AI opponent that has multiple difficulties.
Add support for promotions when a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board.
Add a display showing which pieces have already been taken.
